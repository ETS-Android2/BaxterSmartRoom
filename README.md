# BaxterSmartRoom
## Problem Statement
This is the code repository for the Baxter Smart Room team as part of the senior design project for the 2021-2022 at the University of Rochester. We have designed a prototype Android application that  adresses common infusion pump problems.

Here, we define the main problems of infusion pumps:
* Infusion pump induced alarm fatigue is a significant problem in the clinic [1]
* There is a lack of central monitoring systems for infusion pumps in the hospital care areas
* There is a lack of sufficient communication between the smart pumps and the electronic medical record (EMR)

## Design
We broke our engineering team into two parts: the back-end and front-end team.
